1. Create a variable to store the API Key 
2. Create variables for the API Call where we include the different query parameters. This means we have to accept user input and store it somewhere using a form. 
3. Save the user input somewhere 
4. create the q value where we add the city variable into our search parameter. 
    - also need appID which we get from the API Key variable
5. Based on the City the user selects, get the Zipcode from the geocities API and save that somewhere
6. Also need to grab current weather data 
6. use the fetch API to get the data, and then present it on the page 
7. save search history of previous locations checked 
8. HTML and CSS  

=====
- need to save search results in variable and then add the query selectors in js to add the card element to those results 


** API GEO RESPONSE **
http://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q={city name},{state code},{country code}&limit={limit}&appid={API key}

http://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q={city name},{state code},{country code}&limit={limit}&appid={API key}

q = City name, state code, country code
appid - API Key
limit - number of locations in the API Response (up to 5)


Coordinates by zip/ post code:


- set up if else in case they search via zip code
